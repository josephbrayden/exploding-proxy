# Exploding Proxy

Exploding Proxy is a Node proxy that helps getting custom hidden **Exploding Kittens®** avatars.

## Prerequisites

[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) should be alrerady installed.

You also should already have **Exploding Kittens®** installed on your device
* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.explodingkittens.projectbombsquad)
* [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/exploding-kittens/id1040227414)

## Installation

Clone Exploding Proxy:
```
git clone https://github.com/tribakzero/exploding-proxy.git
```

Move to the project's directory
```
cd exploding-proxy
```

Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

## Usage

To run the script:
```
npm start
```

You need to find your computer's local IP (something like `192.168.100.100`), this is different for each device, but a quick Google search will help you.

You also need to set the proxy value for your prefered wireless network using your IP and the port `3333`.

With that, you only need to open the **Exploding Kittens®**, go to `Game Settings` and tap simultaneously on both `Sound On` and the black kitten for around 8 seconds.

That will show a modal to `Enter a Code`, enter any code and you will be greated with the brand new avatars free to use.
